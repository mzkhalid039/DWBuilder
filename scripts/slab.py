Script: slab.py
Description:
    This script manages the addition of a vacuum layer to an atomic structure. It allows the user to specify 
    the size of the vacuum layer and the direction in which it should be added (along the a, b, or c axis). 
    The script reads the structure from a file, modifies the unit cell to include the vacuum layer, and 
    saves the modified structure in VASP POSCAR format. All actions are logged in a log file.

Key Features:
    - Prompts the user to input the size and direction of the vacuum layer.
    - Modifies the unit cell dimensions based on the userâ€™s input without scaling the atomic positions.
    - Saves the modified structure as 'structure_with_vacuum.vasp' in the current working directory.
    - Logs the operations performed, including the vacuum size and direction, to 'LOGFILE.txt'.

Usage:
    - Run the script by executing `python vacuum_layer_manager.py` and follow the prompts.
    - The user will be asked to provide the input file name, vacuum size, and direction.

Dependencies:
    - ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment): For reading and writing atomic structure files.
    - Colorama: For colored text output in the terminal.

Example:
    $ python vacuum_layer_manager.py
    Enter the input file name (with extension): input_file.vasp
    Enter the size of the vacuum layer in angstroms: 10
    Enter the direction to add the vacuum layer (a, b, or c): c
    Structure with vacuum saved to structure_with_vacuum.vasp

Output:
    - The script produces a VASP POSCAR file with the added vacuum layer.
    - A detailed log of the operation is saved to "LOGFILE.txt".
