# DWBuilder: Domain Wall Builder
Ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain_wall_builder creates domain walls and interface structure for the perovskites and ceramics. The code reads the structure in the vasp format, and then creates domain walls with user-defined sizes and angles.

# Overview
There are three main scripts [dwbuilder.py](scripts/dwbuilder.py), [dbuilder.py](scripts/dbuilder.py) and [hibuilder.py](scripts/hibuilder.py) which build domain wall, single domain structures and experimentally observed atomic interface strutures with known orientation relationships (ORs), respectively. For the domain wall and interfaces, you only need to run [dwbuilder.py](scripts/dwbuilder.py). These scripts can be executed from the command line. I also have included examples of ferroelectric domain walls.

Dependencies
------------

The package requires:

-  **numpy** - http://www.numpy.org/
-  **metplotlib** - https://matplotlib.org/
-  **ASE** - https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
-  **Pymatgen** - https://pymatgen.org/

# Installation guide
For installation simply clone or download the code in your terminal and in the main directory of the package type:
```
> pip install .
```
This will copy the modules to your active python site-packages, thereby making them importable in any python script and will put the scrpits in the python bin, thereby making them executable in the shell.

After installation, you can start the software by running the following command in your terminal:
```
> dwbuilder
```

# Usage
To execute the code, one should run the dwbuilder command from the command line. Upon running, the user will be prompted to input the name of the input structure file, as well as the domain wall angle and size (expressed in number of unit cells). This script builds the domain wall structure based on the space group of the input structure with the assumed polarization directions as indicated below. 

```
R3c (Polarization direction (1-11))
R3m (Polarization direction (001))
P4mm (Polarization direction (001))
p6_3cm (Polarization direction (-1-10))
Pnma (Polarization direction (110))
Pmc2_1 (user-defined)
Amm2 (user-defined)
```

However, if you are unsure about the polarization dirction, you can run [polarization.py](scripts/polarization.py) to determine the polarization direction. This script uses the point charge model and you need to have both optimized ```CONTCAR``` and high symmtry structure ```POSCAR``` files to determine the polarization.

```
[hibuilder.py](scripts/hibuilder.py) generates an initial configuration that needs additional refinement along a, b and c-directions. To determine the optimal interface distance along the a, b, and c axes, you can either perform static DFT or forcefield simulations. Additionally, you may need to explore various interfacial configurations to identify the thermodynamically stable structure.

The above code generates the following interface structure (the periodic image) visualized by [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/):

![image](https://github.com/mzkhalid039/DWBuilder/assets/52278972/19081982-1949-4e16-a734-ca27a6d733bb)

It is also important to know that all the domain wall and interface structures built in this package follow the orthogonality condition, which means lattice vectors a,b and c are mutually perpendicular (i.e., orthognal) to each other and fulfill these conditions: 

```
a x b = c
a x c = b
b x c = a
```

- _**A note on the microscopic degrees of freedom:**_

To find the global minimum of an interface structure, it is essential to calculate the optimal distance between the different bulk phases at the interface. You also need to identify the termination site that corresponds to the structure with the lowest energy, as well as consider the homogeneous interface structures of the periodic images.

To achieve these goals, I often use first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT), specifically with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) at 0 Kelvin. This computational approach helps determine the initial structures for further first-principles calculations. 

# Method for the development of FDW
## R3m
Ferroelectric materials with a rhombohedral space group of R3m exhibit three types of ferroelectric domain walls (FDWs): R71, R109, and R180. Due to neutrality and mechanical compatibility, these FDWs develop along specific planes. For the R180 FDW, the ```{1-10}``` plane is used, while for R71 and R109, the FDWs are determined by the sum of the two polarization vectors.

- **R71 FDW**: Lies parallel to the diagonal ```(1-10)``` plane in the primitive cell.
- **R180 FDW**: Developed along the ```{1-10}``` plane.
- **R109 FDW**: The R109 FDW lies along the ```(100)``` plane, and FDWs are simply developed by stacking the primitive cell along this direction.

To analyze the R71 and R180 FDWs, the pseudocubic rhombohedral unit cell is transformed into a 10-atom cell by rotating it 45Â° around the z-axis relative to the parent cubic unit cell. The transformation matrix applied is given as:

        [ 1  0  1 ]                
    T = [ 1  0 -1 ]       
        [ 0  1  0 ]        

In the script the above transformation matrix is applied in lattice vectors form as given below:

```
a=[1, 1, 0], b=[0, 0, 1], c=[1, -1, 0]

```

**R71**

The R71 domain walls are developed by stacking along the normal direction to the ```[1-10]``` plane, which aligns with the a-axis in the rotated coordinate system. Additionally, the mirror symmtry was developed by tranforming ```[1-10]``` to ```[-110]``` and from ```[001]``` to ```[00-1]```.

For the R71 FDWs, the orientation relationships for both domains (D1 and D2) are:

         [ 1  0  1 ]         [ 1  0 -1 ]          
    D1 = [ 1  0 -1 ]    D2 = [ 1  0  1 ]    
         [ 0  1  0 ]         [ 0 -1  0 ]  

**R180**

Similar to the R71 domain wall, the R180 ```{1-10}``` wall is also parallel to the diagonal plane in the primitive cell. For the R180 FDW:
- A supercell is made by stacking the rotated 10-atom unit cell.
- The final FDWs are developed by stacking along the ```[1-10]``` plane.

```
         [ 1  0  1 ]         [ -1  0   1 ]          
    D1 = [ 1  0 -1 ]    D2 = [ -1  0  -1 ]    
         [ 0  1  0 ]         [  0 -1   0 ]  

```

The transformation ensures that the polarization vectors in the two domains are oriented 180 degrees apart, achieving the necessary mirror symmetry for the R180 domain wall. 

**R109**

 The R109 FDW lies along the ```(100)``` plane. For this FDW:
 
- The domain walls are developed by stacking the primitive cell along the ```(100)``` direction.

This straightforward stacking ensures that the polarization vectors align as required for the R109 domain wall configuration.

```
         [ 1  0  0 ]         [  1  0  0 ]          
    D1 = [ 0  1  0 ]    D2 = [  0 -1  0 ]    
         [ 0  1  1 ]         [  0  0 -1 ]  

```

## R3c
Similar to the R3m, the R3c structure also possesses three FDWs: R71, R109, and R180.  The R3c domain walls are developed by converting the reference R3c structure into a pseudocubic cell. This is done by cutting along the ```(1-11)``` plane, which is also the polarization axis.

The transformation vectors used to convert the R3c structure into a pseudocubic cell are given by the transformation matrix Y:

```
        [ 1 -1  1 ]                
    T = [ 1  1 -1 ]       
        [-1  1  1 ]        

```

The R71 , R109 , and R180 domain walls are found to adopt ```(001)```, ```(110)```, and ```(-110)``` pseudocubic domain wall planes, respectively. The transformation matrix to develop respective domains and domain walls are given as:

```

             [ 1  0  1 ]              [-1  0  1 ]          
    R71_D1 = [-1  0  1 ]    R71_D2 =  [ 1  0  1 ]    
             [ 0  1  0 ]              [ 0 -1  0 ]  

              [ 0  1  0 ]              [ 0 -1  0 ]          
    R109_D1 = [ 1  0  0 ]    R109_D2 = [-1  0  0 ]    
              [ 0  0  1 ]              [ 0  0  1 ]  
                      
              [ 1  0 -1 ]              [-1  0 -1 ]          
    R180_D1 = [ 1  0  1 ]    R180_D2 = [-1  0  1 ]    
              [ 0 -1  0 ]              [ 0  1  0 ]  

```
The R109 domain walls are formed by stacking the D1 and D2 domains along the ```[001]```, while R71 and R180 are stacked along the ```[110]``` and ```[-110]``` directions, respectively.

## P4mm
In the P4mm space group, with the polarization direction along the `[001]` direction, there are two types of domain walls allowed and developed in `dwbuilder`:

1. **T180 Domain Walls (T180)**:
   - **Orientation**: These domain walls are on the `(100)` planes.
   - **Polarization**: The polarization vectors in neighboring domains are parallel but oriented in opposite directions.

2. **T90 Domain Walls**:
   - ***Orientation**: These domain walls are on the `(101)` planes.
   - ***Polarization**: The polarization vectors on either side of the domain wall are almost perpendicular to each other.

The transformation matrix used for both domain walls are given as:

```

              [ 1  0  0 ]               [ -1  0   0 ]          
    T180_D1 = [ 0  1  0 ]    T180_D2 =  [  0  1   0 ]    
              [ 0  0  1 ]               [  0  0  -1 ]  

             [ 0  -1  1 ]             [ 0  -1   1 ]          
    T90_D1 = [ 1   0  0 ]    T90_D2 = [ -1  0   0 ]    
             [ 0   1  1 ]             [ 0  -1   1 ]  

```

The T180 and T90 FDWs are develed by stacking along the ```[010]``` and ```[101]``` direction.

## P6_3cm

The hexagonal manganites RMnO3 ( R= Sc, Y, Dy-Lu) belongs to the P6_3cm hexagonal space group. This space group is non-centrosymmetric, thus lacking inversion symmetry, which is a necessary condition for ferroelectricity. The polar axis for this group is along the `[001]` direction.

### Origin of Polarization

The polarization within hexagonal manganites originates from the structural tilt trimerization of the MnO5 polyhedra. Trimerization is characterized by two angles:
1. **Tilt Angle (Î¸)**:
   - This is the angle between the `[001]` direction and the Mn-apical O bond.
   - It gives the magnitude of the tilting and can be regarded as the order parameter.
2. **Azimuthal Angle (Ï)**:
   - This angle describes the orientation of the tilting.
   - During the phase transition, (Ï) adopts one of six values separated by 60Â°, corresponding to trimerization around three possible origins with either in- or out-orientation of the tilting.

Based on the stacking site, there exist two kinds of domain walls within hexagonal manganites:

1. **Neutral Domain Walls (NDW)**:
   - **Formation**: NDWs are developed by stacking the positive and negative domains perpendicular to the `[001]` axis.
   - **Polarization**: This stacking creates net zero polarization at the domain walls due to the cancellation of the positive and negative polarization of both domains.

2. **Charged Domain Walls (CDW)**:
   - **Formation**: CDWs are formed by stacking two different domains along the `[001]` direction.
   - **Polarization**: This results in a net polarization at the domain walls, leading to charged domain walls.

### Developing Domain Walls with `dwbuilder`

In `dwbuilder`, we have developed two scripts, `ndw.py` and `cdw.py`, to create these domain walls while maintaining hexagonal symmetry. To run these scripts, users need to provide the input domain structures for both domains.

- **`ndw.py`**: This script is used to develop neutral domain walls (NDW).
- **`cdw.py`**: This script is used to develop charged domain walls (CDW).

By providing the necessary input structures, these scripts will generate the respective domain walls within the hexagonal manganites. 

**Note**: You do not explicitly need to run these scripts directly. `DWBuilder` automatically detects the space group and, based on the space group, prompts users to provide details of the input structure and parameters.

## Pnma

The (Pnma) space group is non-polar, yet some materials within this group exhibit ferroelastic domain walls. `DWBuilder` generates domain walls for materials that typically crystallize in a non-polar (Pnma) structure under ambient conditions. This structure features antiferrodistortive (AFD) distortions, involving the tilting and rotation of the oxygen octahedra, which also lead to spontaneous ferroelastic strain.

### Ferroelectric Instability

- **Parent Cubic Phase**: In its parent cubic phase, the material exhibits a secondary ferroelectric (FE) instability.
- **Polar Displacement**: This instability arises from the polar displacement of ions (e.g., titanium ions within the oxygen octahedra), leading to ferroelectric polarization.

### Domain Walls

`DWBuilder` generates twin ferroelastic domain walls between the `[110]` and `[1-10]` domains. These walls suppress the primary AFD order parameter, activating the secondary FE instability at the twin walls. Consequently, these twin domain walls possess their own dipole moments within a ferroelastic paraelectric matrix, contributing to the overall properties of the material.

The transformation matrix used for this space group is given as:

```

              [ 1  0  1 ]               [ -1  0   1 ]          
         D1 = [ 1  0 -1 ]         D2 =  [  1  0   1 ]    
              [ 0  1  0 ]               [  0  1   0 ]  

```
The domain walls lie along the `[110]` direction.

## Pmc2_1 & Amm2

The Pmc2_1 and Amm2 space groups belong to the orthorhombic crystal system. Materials within these space groups can exhibit O90 and O180 (O for orthorhombic) domain walls. `DWBuilder` generates these domain walls by applying a rotation matrix around the c-axis.

### Procedure

1. **User Input**:
   - The program initially prompts the user to enter the input structure in VASP format.
   - The user is then asked to select the polar axis.

2. **Rotation Matrix Application**:
   - Based on the user selection, `DWBuilder` applies the rotation matrix to develop the domain walls.
   - The rotation matrix is applied around the c-axis.

 ```

              [ cos(Î³)  -sin(Î³)  1 ]                    
      Rc(Î³) = [ sin(Î³)   cos(Î³) -1 ]        
              [ 0         0      0 ]               

```


3.  **Polar Axis Adjustment**:
   - `DWBuilder` ensures that the polar axis does not lie along the c-axis before applying the rotation matrix.
   - If the user selects the a-axis as the polar axis, the structure is kept as is.
   - If the b-axis or c-axis is selected as the polar axis, the structure is rotated by applying a transformation matrix as given below, aligning the a-axis as the polar axis.
   - After aligning the a-axis as the polar axis, `DWBuilder` applies the rotation matrix around the c-axis by applying `(Rc(Î³))`.

```
       [ 1  0  0 ]       [ 0  0  1 ]        [ 0  1  0 ]          
 Ra =  [ 0  1  0 ]  Rb = [ 1  0  0 ]  Rc =  [ 0  0  1 ]    
       [ 0  0  1 ]       [ 0  1  0 ]        [ 1  0  0 ]  
```

4.  **O120 Head-to-Head/Tail-to-Tail and Head-to-Tail domain walls**:

For O120 domain walls, `DWBuilder` builds two variants: Head-to-Head/Tail-to-Tail (O120_HH_TT) and Head-to-Tail (O120_HT) domain walls. The O120_HH_TT domain wall is developed by stacking the rotated domains parallel to each other, resulting in polarization meeting head-to-head on one end and tail-to-tail on the other side due to the periodic boundary condition. In contrast, the O120_HT domain wall is developed by stacking the rotated domains perpendicular to each other, ensuring a head-to-tail configuration.

## - _**A note on the selection of domain wall termination sites:**_

`DWBuilder` develops domain wall supercells by generating and stacking two different domains, with the termination of the domains depending on the input unit cell termination. For example, PbTiO3 in the P4mm space group can have TiO- or PbO-terminated domain wall structures. To develop both variants, the user needs to define the input unit cell structure such that in one variant, the Pb atom is in the center, leading to PbO-terminated domain walls, while in the other, the Ti atom is in the center, resulting in TiO-terminated domain walls (See [example](examples/P4mm)). Additionally, for complex systems, `DWBuilder` includes a function to add one or two layers by defining the domain size in fractional form (e.g., 2.5), providing precise control over the domain wall structure and thickness.
